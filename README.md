# Uber Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze Uber ride data using R programming language to gain insights into the patterns and trends of Uber rides in a specific city. The analysis will focus on factors such as time of day, and day of the week, and to identify popular routes and peak times of demand. We can infer valuable information from the graphs and tables to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Uber's Operations.

The Key features and technical aspects used in this analysis are as follows:
- R programming (for speed and ease of use)
- Data Visualization (Using packages(ggplot, plotly, etc.) provided with R)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Checking for missing values)
- Data Analysis using the output visuals such as time-based analysis, general trends, etc.
